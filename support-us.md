		<p>We maintain a stock of over a thousand books spanning every genre. <a href="#high-demand-books">Below</a> is a list of highly-requested of books. To donate books directly to the group, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.general_email }}?subject=Book%20Donation">contact us</a> and we will work with you to schedule your book donation drop off at a socially-distanced location in Carrboro.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>If you would like to order high-demand books, we keep an active <a href="{{ site.flyleaf_wishlist }}">wish list</a> at FlyLeaf, a local, independent bookstore. When books are purchased from our wish list, we pick them up and bring them to the workspace.</p>
		<p><i>Note: We can only accept <strong>paperback books</strong>, as required by prisons, and cannot accept books with markings or highlighting, images of nudity, gang-related material, or anything related to tattooing. </i></p> <p><i>Also, we ask donors to be considerate of the books they donate; while we appreciate all donations, time spent weeding out unusable books is time we could otherwise spend responding to requests. If you aren't sure if a donation would be helpful, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.general_email }}?subject=Book%20Donation">ask</a>! Also, please do not donate fiction unless it falls under the categories listed (we have more than we need!). </i></p>

		<p>We meet weekly on Sunday afternoons to put together packages for our recipients, sort through and shelve book donations, and listen to 80s rock on our dusty old CD player. You should join us! We can also use help with administrative things like communications, design, sourcing books, and coordinating with NC carceral institutions. If you're interested or have any questions, just <a href="mailto:{{ site.general_email }}?subject=Volunteering">send us an email</a>.</p>
		<p>Since fall 2021 we have been slowly been bringing in new volunteers. We ask all volunteers to wear masks while in the space, and to provide proof of vaccination on their first visit. To limit the number of people in our smallish space, we run two shifts on Sunday, from 12:00p - 2:30p and from 2:30p - 5:00p.</p>

		<p>While our work helps people survive an unjust system, we recognize that the work of reform requires advocacy on a state and national scale.</p>
