		<p>Each month we spend around $500 on postage. This is our largest expense. Your donation will ensure that we can continue mailing books directly to incarcerated people at no cost to them.</p>

		<h2 id="donate-books">Donate paperback books.</h2>
		<p>We maintain a stock of over a thousand books spanning every genre. <a href="#high-demand-books">Below</a> is a list of highly-requested of books. To donate books directly to the group, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.help_email }}?subject=Book%20Donation">contact us</a> and we will work with you to schedule a socially-distant pickup. We ask donors to be considerate of the books they donate; while we appreciate all donations, time spent weeding out unusable books is time we could otherwise spend responding to requests. If you aren't sure if a donation would be helpful, please <a href="mailto:{{ site.help_email }}?subject=Book%20Donation">ask</a>! Also, please do not donate fiction unless it falls under the categories listed (we have more than we need!). </p>
		<p>If you would like to order high-demand books, we keep an active <a href="{{ site.flyleaf_wishlist }}">wish list</a> at FlyLeaf, a local, independent bookstore. When books are purchased from our wish list, we pick them up and bring them to the workspace. We also have a <a href="{{ site.patron_signup }}">patron sign up form</a> for people who are interested in purchasing specific requests that we don't have in stock. Patrons receive a periodic email listing these requests, which they are asked to purchase as they're able. This is a meaningful way to provide recipients the exact book they're looking for.</p>
		<p><i>Note: We can only accept <strong>paperback books</strong>, as required by prisons, and cannot accept books with markings or highlighting, images of nudity, gang-related material, or anything related to tattooing.</i></p>

		<p>Because we work in a relatively small space, we are waiting to allow guest volunteer visits until North Carolina raises quarantine restrictions. We will post updates to our <a href="{{ site.facebook_link }}">Facebook page</a> about our volunteer policy as North Carolina moves into new quarantine phases. We are keeping an eye on the North Carolina <a href="https://www.nc.gov/covid19">COVID response website</a> to stay aware of changes.</p>
		<p>A core group of PBC volunteers, however, is continuing to meet each week to fulfill book requests, and we continue to receive hundreds of requests each month.</p>

		<p>While our work helps people survive an unjust system, we recognize that the work of reform requires advocacy on a state and national scale.</p>
