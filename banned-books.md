		<p>Incarcerated people are often prevented from receiving books for a variety reasons, including the condition of the book, if it was improperly addressed, or if it is on a banned list. And while many books are understandably prohibited for safety reasons, others, like <i>The Color Purple</i> and <i>Homesteading</i>, raise some questions.</p> 
		<p>Thankfully, public pressure can reverse bans. In 2018, the New York Times wrote about <i>The New Jim Crow</i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/new-jim-crow-book-ban-prison.html">showing up on prisons' banned book lists</a> across the country (one of PBC's own was interviewed for the story!). A week later, in a response to a letter from the North Carolina A.C.L.U., NC prisons <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/us/new-jim-crow-north-carolina.html">dropped the ban</a>. Nevertheless, the following books (and many more) remain banned:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i></p></li>
			<li><p><i>Where the Crawdads Sing</i></p></li>
			<li><p><i>The Burning: Black Wall Street and the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921</i></p></li>
			<li><p><i>Coding for Beginners</i></p></li>
			<li><p><i>Hand's Up Don't Shoot</i></p></li>
			<li><p><i>Life Drawing</i></p></li>
			<li><p><i>Orange Is the New Black</i></p></li>
		</ul>
