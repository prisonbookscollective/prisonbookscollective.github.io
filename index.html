		<h2>Serving Incarcerated People</h2>
		<p>Each year we send over a thousand books and resources free of charge to people in prison who otherwise couldnâ€™t afford them.</p>
		<p>These materials provide education and life skills as well as joy, relief, and a sense of connection to the world. We have recipients who have been with us for years and hear from new ones every week.</p>

		<h2>Providing a Support Line</h2>
		<p>Imprisoned people are underserved in every way imaginable. We view our work as a small but necessary way of counteracting the injustices of the incarceration system. Our goal is to provide resources that help people during their imprisonment and as they prepare to transition back to society.</p>
